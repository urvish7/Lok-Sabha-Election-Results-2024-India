 Lok-Sabha-Election-Results-2024-India Analysis

 In April 2024, India held the world's largest democratic elections, with over 900 million people registered to vote. The Narendra Modi-led government ran for a third consecutive term, with key contenders battling for 543 seats across the nation. The BJP-led NDA coalition emerged as the winner with 293 seats, but the ruling party fell short of the halfway mark of 272 seats, relying on the National Democratic Alliance and its regional parties to form a stable government. The elections were conducted electronically across the country, with over a million nationwide polling stations. The elections were estimated to be the most expensive in the world.

High profile arrests and farmer protests laid the groundwork for the national elections. The BJP's victory in three state assembly elections in December 2023 provided a boost to the incumbent party, while the opposition INC won the southern state of Telangana. The ruling party was embroiled in the issue of political funding through electoral bonds, which was deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.

Despite unemployment and inflation remaining key challenges, Modi's popularity at domestic and world levels remains unchallenged. The Modi-led NDA successfully claimed a third term in office, but the victory was much narrower than anticipated by the media, supermajority indicating exit polls, and the incumbent party itself. The winning alliance will be called upon by the President to prove its majority within a specified timeframe.
